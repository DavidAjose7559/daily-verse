  "context": "<p><strong>Pretext:</strong> In the preceding verses of 3 John, the apostle John addresses Gaius, a beloved friend and fellow believer. John commends Gaius for his faithfulness to the truth and his hospitality towards the brethren, particularly those who are strangers. Gaius's actions reflect his commitment to God and the Christian community, setting the stage for the commendation in verse 6.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Context:</strong> The verse itself, 3 John 1:6, continues John's commendation of Gaius's love and hospitality. The \"they\" refers to the brothers and sisters in Christ who have received Gaius's hospitality and have testified to his love before the church. John encourages Gaius to continue supporting these traveling believers by sending them on their journey in a manner worthy of God, emphasizing the importance of assisting those who labor for the truth.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Post-text:</strong> Following this verse, John further explains the reason for supporting such individuals. He notes that these travelers are working for the sake of the Name (Christ), and they accept nothing from the Gentiles. Therefore, it is crucial for fellow believers to support and welcome them, becoming \"fellow workers for the truth\" (3 John 1:8).</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Key Greek Word 1:</strong> <em>Assembly</em> - <em>ἐκκλησία (ekklesia)</em> - Generally refers to a gathering or congregation, often used in the New Testament to denote the Christian community or church.</li>\n    <li><strong>Key Greek Word 2:</strong> <em>Worthy</em> - <em>ἀξίως (axios)</em> - Meaning suitably or in a manner befitting or worthy, often used to express conduct that is appropriate to the calling or status of a believer.</li>\n</ul>"
